# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Initialize a demo project locally
npm install

npm run dev and play with the local dev environment.

# React Router DOM
The react-router-dom package contains bindings for using React Router in web applications. Please see the Getting Started guide for more information on how to get started with React Router.
